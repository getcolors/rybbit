# One desired state, three colours, byte for byte. golden.sh is green's
# regression net against the committed goldens; this is the net across colours:
# each fixture is rendered by green, red, and blue into separate work
# directories and the trees must be identical — and the template trees each
# colour carries must be identical too, because the copies are the mechanism
# (red/resources and blue's embedded resources are copies of green's tree, not
# references to it).
#
# Two fixtures, because rybbit supports two compute providers and providers are
# selected by template directory: parity means the DigitalOcean tree and the
# Vultr tree (with its generated firewall.tf.json) both hold in every colour.
#
# Renders resolve each colour's package from this working tree (the
# RYBBIT_LIB_ROOT overrides), while green, once, red, and blue stay on their
# pins — a change that lands here passes parity before it is pushed or pinned
# anywhere.
