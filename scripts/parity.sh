# One desired state, three colours, byte for byte. golden.sh is green's
# regression net against the committed goldens; this is the net across colours:
# each fixture is rendered by green, red, and blue into separate work
# directories and the trees must be identical — and the template trees each
# colour carries must be identical too, because the copies are the mechanism
# (red/resources and blue's embedded resources are copies of green's tree, not
# references to it).
#
# Four fixtures, one per advertised compute provider per keypair mode: the SSH
# Keypair Standard has two modes and parity means both keygen and opt-out hold
# in every colour, and providers are selected by template directory, so the
# DigitalOcean tree and the Vultr tree (with its generated firewall.tf.json)
# must both hold in every colour too.
#
# Renders resolve each colour's package from this working tree (the
# RYBBIT_LIB_ROOT overrides), while green, once, red, and blue stay on their
# pins — a change that lands here passes parity before it is pushed or pinned
# anywhere.
